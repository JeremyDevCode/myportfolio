        "description": "In 2019, I discovered my passion for programming and decided to study it while in school. I began by learning Pseint and then progressed to C++, Java, and eventually HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was during this time that I discovered my love for web development, particularly in frontend development. As I aspire to become a frontend developer, I have been working on several projects. Initially, I worked on long projects that I ended up abandoning. However, I learned that shorter, aesthetically-pleasing projects that demonstrate my skills are much better.",
